In this SQL project, I conducted an exploratory analysis using SQL queries on the 'Busiest Airports of Europe 2021' dataset.

The original dataset was sourced from Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/busiest-airports-of-europe/data?select=Busiest-European-Airports-2021.csv 

For the analysis, I utilized PostgreSQL and imported the CSV file into pgAdmin 4 to proceed with the examination.
